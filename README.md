Build a very simple term deposit calculator that takes as inputs:

- Start deposit amount (e.g. $10,000)
- Interest rate (e.g. 1.10%)
- Investment term (e.g. 3 years)
- Interest paid (Monthly, Quarterly, Annually, At Maturity)

Final balance (e.g. $10,330 on the above inputs, interest paid At Maturity)
You can assume that all proceeds are reinvested into the term deposit for its duration.
